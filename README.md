# News-App
Create a news application by using an open API (https://newsapi.org/) to pull data from and and show all the news in next page.
The functionalities that should be present in the app needs to be:
    All the news should be present in a card view fashion
    Each card should display each news post
    One can search from the list and filter the card
    Each card should have following details

    Title
    Description
    Posted time ago e.g. 2 hours ago
    Source of the news e.g. BBC
    An image at the right side of the card

The cards should be sorted in a descending order with respect to the time. There should be 100 posts without any filter
show a count somewhere in the screen that represents the number of cards in the list when unfiltered or even when filtered
and while scrolling there shouldnâ€™t be any lag in UI so make sure to use the appropriate libraries.

Third Party Library
1.Glide = For use of load image 
2.SSp and SDP = This size unit scales with the screen size based on the sp size unit (for texts). It can help Android developers with supporting multiple screens.This is the sibling of the sdp size unit that should be used for non text views.
3. Data Binding = The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
4.Retrofit = Retrofit will save our  development time, And also you can keep your code in developer friendly. Retrofit has given almost all the API's to make server call and to receive response. internally they also use GSON to do the parsing 
5.Lifecycle Component
